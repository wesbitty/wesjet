The Wesjet CLI enables you to transform you content into data.

## Usage

```txt
wesjet <command> [options]
```

To get a list of all commands, you can run `wesjet` with the `--help` flag:

```txt
wesjet --help
```

Which will produce an output that looks like this:

```txt
━━━ Wesjet CLI - 0.0.2 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  $ wesjet <command>

━━━ General commands ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  wesjet build [-c,--config #0] [--clearCache] [--verbose]
    Transforms your content into static data

  wesjet dev [-c,--config #0] [--clearCache] [--verbose]
    Same as "wesjet build" but with watch mode

You can also print more details about any of these commands by calling them
with the `-h,--help` flag right after the command name.
```

## Commands

### `build`

```txt
wesjet build [options]
```

Transforms content into data objects that your pages and components can consume. These objects are written to files in the `.wesjet/jetpack` directory.

### `dev`

```txt
wesjet dev [options]
```

Runs a build, then listens for changes to your content files, rebuilding after each change.

## Options

The following options are available to run with each command.

### `config` (alias: `-c`)

Use a custom config file path. Both `wesjet.config.ts` and `wesjet.config.js` work by default.

### `clearCache`

Clears the `.wesjet/jetpack` directory before running the specified command.

### `verbose`

Adds more detailed output when running a command.

### `help`

Generates usage instructions and options for the CLI. Does not require an associated command.

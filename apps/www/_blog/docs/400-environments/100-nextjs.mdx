excerpt: Use the wesjet-nextjs-plugin plugin to tightly integrate Wesjet into a Next.js project.

Wesjet has full support for Next.js projects, including live reloading (if you follow the recommended approach below).

## Installation & Configuration

Using Wesjet in a Next.js project is easiest if you use the [`wesjet-nextjs-plugin`](/docs/reference/wesjet-nextjs-plugin) plugin. Install the plugin:

```txt
npm install wesjet-nextjs-plugin
```

Then wrap your next configuration object in the [`withWesjet` utility](/docs/reference/wesjet-nextjs-plugin#withwesjet).

```js
// next.config.js
import { withWesjet } from 'wesjet-nextjs-plugin'
export default withWesjet({})
```

## Working with Images

Image processing with Wesjet is not currently supported, although we're planning on it. The current recommendation is to place images in the `public` directory, and then use a `string` field to store the path to that image.

Alternatively, you can store your images in an asset service like Cloudinary or Imgix. [See here for more detail](/docs/maker/files/images) on our current recommendation for image processing.

### Using next/image in Body Content

If you want to use `next/image` to render your images, create a component to wrap `next/image` and add the image via component markup in your markdown or MDX file.

For example, say we have an `Image` component in our project that wraps the `next/image`.

```jsx
import Image as NextImage from 'next/image'

const Image = (props) => {
  return <NextImage /* ... */ />
}
```

You content should then call this component directly.

```md
Other markdown content ...

<Image src="..." />
```

You can either use an `.mdx` file to have this content processed automatically, or you can use a tool like [`markdown-to-jsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-to-jsx) with raw markdown.

## Using TypeScript

Using TypeScript with Next.js is optional, but [we _highly_ recommend it](/docs/concepts/type-safety).

Next.js works great with TypeScript. [Their docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript) show how to add TypeScript to new and existing projects. It also lists useful types provided by Next.js.

### Using Preact

Preact can be used with a custom Webpack config. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/wesbitty/wesjetpkg/issues/62) for details.

excerpt: Use the next-contentlayer plugin to tightly integrate Contentlayer into a Next.js project.

Contentlayer has full support for Next.js projects, including live reloading (if you follow the recommended approach below).

## Installation & Configuration

Using Contentlayer in a Next.js project is easiest if you use the [`next-contentlayer`](/docs/reference/next-contentlayer) plugin. Install the plugin:

```txt
npm install next-contentlayer
```

Then wrap your next configuration object in the [`withContentlayer` utility](/docs/reference/next-contentlayer#withcontentlayer).

```js
// next.config.js
import { withContentlayer } from 'next-contentlayer'
export default withContentlayer({})
```

## Working with Images

Image processing with Contentlayer is not currently supported, although we're planning on it. The current recommendation is to place images in the `public` directory, and then use a `string` field to store the path to that image.

Alternatively, you can store your images in an asset service like Cloudinary or Imgix. [See here for more detail](/docs/sources/files/images) on our current recommendation for image processing.

### Using next/image in Body Content

If you want to use `next/image` to render your images, create a component to wrap `next/image` and add the image via component markup in your markdown or MDX file.

For example, say we have an `Image` component in our project that wraps the `next/image`.

```jsx
import Image as NextImage from 'next/image'

const Image = (props) => {
  return <NextImage /* ... */ />
}
```

You content should then call this component directly.

```md
Other markdown content ...

<Image src="..." />
```

You can either use an `.mdx` file to have this content processed automatically, or you can use a tool like [`markdown-to-jsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-to-jsx) with raw markdown.

## Content live-reload (HMR)

Content live reload should work out-of-the-box with Next.js when using the `next-contentlayer` plugin and importing your content (e.g. `import { allPosts } from 'contentlayer/generated'`) directly in your page app/components.

However, in some cases (due to a bug in Next.js) you might need to add the following hook to your app/page components:

```tsx
import { useLiveReload } from 'next-contentlayer/hooks';
import { allPosts } from 'contentlayer/generated';

export function MyPage() {
  useLiveReload() // this only runs during development and has no impact on production

  return <div>Your app</div>
}
```

## Using TypeScript

Using TypeScript with Next.js is optional, but [we _highly_ recommend it](/docs/concepts/type-safety).

Next.js works great with TypeScript. [Their docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript) show how to add TypeScript to new and existing projects. It also lists useful types provided by Next.js.

### Using Preact

Preact can be used with a custom Webpack config. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/62) for details.
